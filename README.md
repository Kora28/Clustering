# GMM-Clustering
Developed unsupervised clustering algorithms from scratch in MATLAB for multidimensional data.

First Algorithm is Expectation Maximization ALgorithm and tested with different data sets. 

Second Algorithm is Variational Inference Algorithm which is based on Bayes Theorem to improve the time complexity of the Algorithm.

Some of the data sets which are used for testing the algorithms are:

i)    Iris data set

ii)   4d data set

iii)  6d data set

iv)   10d data set

v)    34d data set
